Airbnb Clone Backend Requirements Specifications
This document outlines the technical and functional requirements for three key backend features of the Airbnb Clone: User Authentication, Property Management, and Booking System. Each section includes API endpoints, input/output specifications, validation rules, and performance criteria to guide development and ensure robust implementation.
1. User Authentication
Overview
The User Authentication feature enables Guests, Hosts, and Admins to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. It supports email/password authentication and OAuth (e.g., Google, Facebook) for seamless access.
Functional Requirements

User Registration: Allow users to create accounts with email/password or OAuth.
User Login: Authenticate users via email/password or OAuth, issuing JWT tokens.
Profile Management: Allow users to update profile details (e.g., name, contact info, profile photo).
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Differentiate permissions for Guests, Hosts, and Admins.

Technical Requirements

Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL table users with fields: id (UUID), email (string), password_hash (string), name (string), phone (string), profile_photo_url (string), role (enum: guest, host, admin), created_at (timestamp), updated_at (timestamp).
Authentication: JWT for session management, OAuth 2.0 for third-party logins.
File Storage: AWS S3/Cloudinary for profile photos.
Security: Passwords hashed with bcrypt, HTTPS for API calls, rate limiting on login attempts.

Notes

Security: All endpoints require HTTPS, JWT authentication, and RBAC to restrict access.
Error Handling: Implement global error handling with consistent error messages and logging (e.g., using a logging framework like Winston).
Scalability: Use Redis caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., property availability, booking statuses) to reduce database load.
Testing: Unit and integration tests (using pytest) for all endpoints, covering success and error cases. API testing with tools like Postman.
Performance: Optimize database queries with indexes on users.email, properties.id, bookings.property_id, and bookings.start_date. Use load balancers for high throughput.
